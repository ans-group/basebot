        Creating a new project
      </h3>
      <p>
        To create a new project, install the basebot CLI tool and run the <code
          class="language-bash">basebot create</code> command. This will scaffold a new project in your current
        directory. Fill in the prompts and customise your project to your requirements. You will be asked the
        following questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Project Name:</strong> your project name (used to create a directory at your current location)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bot Name:</strong> The name of your bot. This will potentially be seen by end users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Channels:</strong> How users will access your bot. Use &lt;space&gt; to select and &lt;enter&gt; to
          continue. You can
          select as many channels as you like.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Storage:</strong> Where bot-related information will be stored.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>NLP Engine:</strong> What service you want to use for NLP/NLU (optional).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Authentication:</strong> Any oAuth modules you want to enable.
        </li>
      </ul>

        npm i -g basebot-cli
        basebot create
        ? What is your project name? (This will create a folder in your current directory) my-first-bot
        ? What is the name of your bot? Barbara Botface
        ? How do you want people to be able to access your bot? Microsoft Bot Service
        ? What do you want to use for storage? Azure Table Storage
        ? Do you wish to use an NLP service? Microsoft LUIS
        ? (Optional) Do you require any third party authorization support? None

        Configuring your environment
      </h3>
      <p>
        Once the create script is complete, you'll find a .env file in the newly-created project folder.
        This file will contain a number of fields depending on your module selection. These should all be filled in
        before you can run your app.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most cases the value you need is self explanatory,
        for example, <code class="language-base">AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code> would be a secret access key for AWS
        (usually from an IAM user).
        However, if you do get stuck, just check the documentation for the module in question (the module that requires
        said env var is commented above each var).

        Once you've filled in your env vars you should be ready to run your app in dev mode. To do this just use the
        <code class="language-base">npm run dev</code> command.
