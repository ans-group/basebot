This guide is used to deploy and configure the infrastructure required to run the Base Bot.

The guide may look complicated at times but please stick with it, it's actually much simpler than it looks, and we expect it to only take around 75 minutes to complete. However if you are an ANS customer and would like help with the deployment, please reach out to your ANS account manager who can arrange for technical assistance.

# Pre-Requisites

Please ensure you meet the below pre-requisites.

* An active Azure Subscription
* Admin Permissions to Azure Subscription
* Admin Permissions to Azure AD to create application registrations
* Git client installed

# Bot Channels Registration

Please follow this guide to create and register and configure a Bot Channels registration.

You need a Bot Channels Registration to be able to use Bot Service functionality. A bot registration lets you connect your bot to channels.

## To create a Bot Channels Registration, follow these steps

1. Login to the Azure portal https://portal.azure.com 

2. Click the **Create a resource** link found on the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal, then select AI + Machine Learning > Bot Channels Registration, you may need to click see all.

3. A new blade will open with information about the Bot Channels Registration. Click the Create button to start the creation process.

4. In the Bot Service blade, provide the requested information about your bot as specified in the table below the image.

    **Recommended Settings**

    | Setting | Suggested value | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Bot name:** | Your bots display name | *The display name for the bot that appears in channels and directories. This should be 6 - 8 characters long. Please make a note of the name as it will be required in later steps* |
    | **Subscription:** | Your subscription | *Select the Azure subscription you want to use.* |
    | **Resource Group** | myResourceGroup | *You can create a new resource group or choose from an existing one.*|
    | **Location**: | UK West | *Choose a location near where your bot is deployed or near other services your bot will access.* |
    | **Pricing tier** | F0 | *Select a pricing tier. You may update the pricing tier at any time. For more information, see Bot Service pricing.*
    | **Messaging endpoint** | Leave empty | *This will be the url of Azure Web App that hosts the bot server*  + /botframework/receive. **Leave empty for now** |
    | **Application Insights** | Off | *Decide if you want to turn Application Insights On or Off. If you select On, you must also specify a regional location.* |
    | **Microsoft App ID and password** | Auto create App ID and password |*Leave this as Auto create, a new Microsoft App ID and password will be created for you in the bot creation process.* |

5. Click Create to create the service and register your bots messaging end point.

6. Confirm that the registration has been created by checking the Notifications. The notifications will change from Deployment in progress... to Deployment succeeded. Click Go to resource button to open the bots resources blade.

## Bot Channels Registration password

The Bot Channels Registration bot service does not have an app service associated with it. Because of that, this bot service only has a MicrosoftAppID. You need to generate the password manually and save it yourself. You will need this password.

To generate a MicrosoftAppPassword, follow these steps

1. On the Bot registration page, click on the **Settings** link

2. From the Settings blade, click **Manage**. This is the link appearing by the Microsoft App ID. This link will open a window where you can generate a new password. Login using your Azure credentials. *Note: You will need to have been assigned at least, the "Application administrator" role in your Azure AD.*

    <img src="{{ "/images/bot-registration02.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Create Bot" width="400"/>

3. On the registration page, copy the **Application Id** and save it to a file, this will be the **ms_app_id** and is required during the bot server deployment.

4. Click **Generate New Password**. This will generate a new password for your bot. Copy the password and save it to a file, this will be the **ms_app_password** and is required during the bot server deployment. *Note: This is the only time you will see this password, if you do not save the password you will need to repeat the process.*

## Add Direct Line Channel connection

The native mobile application requires a Direct Line channel connection key, to create this follow the below steps

1. On the Bot registration page, click on the **Channels** link

2. Click on the Direct Line button, (Globe Icon)

    <img src="{{ "/images/bot-registration04.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Create Bot" width="400"/>

# Build Native Apps (optional)

Please follow this guide to build the native Bot client apps for Apple IOS and Android devices. 

We have documented and simplified the build process, however this guide expects you to have an good level of knowledge in the building and deployment of native mobile applications, including the process of code signing and submitting apps to the Apple and Google app stores.

If you are an ANS customer and require assistance please contact your ANS account manager.


## Pre-requisites Apple IOS

To build the Apple IOS app you must have an [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com) Account and paid subscription.

In the [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com) portal you need to have created.

- iOS App Development certificate *(Create the certificate [here](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/certificate/create))*
- Apple Push Notifications service (APNs) key *(Follow the "Create the authentication key" steps [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/certs) and ensure you have the downloaded key available for later.)*


You will also need with the following software and packages installed.

- X-Code
- usbmuxd
- libimobiledevice
- ideviceinstaller
- ios-deploy
- node.js
- git client

Which can be installed use the brew commands below.

- brew update
- brew install --HEAD usbmuxd
- brew link usbmuxd
- brew install --HEAD libimobiledevice
- brew install ideviceinstaller
- brew install ios-deploy

## Pre-requisites Android

To build the Android app you must have a [Keystore](https://flutter.io/docs/deployment/android#create-a-keystore) for Code Signing the app along following software and plugins installed.


- Android Studio
    - Flutter Plugin
    - Dart Plugin
- node.js
- git client


## Setup
ANS have created a CLI tool, that will help simplify the process, of downloading the source code and creating a project and initial debug build.

1. To get started open a command window and enter the below commands.

        sudo npm i -g @webantic/basebot-cli
        basebot create

2. Follow the on screen instructions of the CLI tool answering the questions below.

- What is the name of your app? *(Enter the same name as entered during the bot registration)*

- What should your app bundle be called? *(Hit enter to accept default)*

- What is the name of the bot? *(Enter the same name as entered during the bot registration)*

- Install Flutter? *(Yes - Unless you already have Flutter installed)*

- Create and link Firebase project? *(Yes, you will be asked to sign in with a Google Account - If you select no you will will need to manually create a firebase project with IOS and Android apps, see [Firebase Registration](./documents/firebase-registration/README.md).)*

- Paste your Direct Line secret *(This was created earlier during the [Azure Bot Channels Registration](./documents/bot-registration/README.md) process.)*

- Paste your Endpoint Url *(This is the Url of the Azure Webapp hosting the Bot server, it can be found in the template.deployment outputs)*

- What is the bot handle on Direct Line? (Enter the same name as entered during the bot registration)

- Where is your keystore located for signing? *(This is required for signing Android app and is not required for IOS, see Android pre-requisites section above.)*

- What is your key alias? *(This is required for signing Android app and is not required for IOS, see Android pre-requisites section above.)*

- What is your key password? *(This is required for signing Android app and is not required for IOS, see Android pre-requisites section above.)*

4. A new directory containing the Bot app source code will have been created with the same name you entered in Step 1 of the CLI tool, CD into this directory.

### Update Azure Bot Server Firebase config
